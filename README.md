Install Node https://nodejs.org/en/
Install Cypress
    when you have installed Node you can just `npm install cypress`
Install the browser you want to use with Cypress dashboard: I used Chrome for testing

### Run it locally

Manually start Cypress dashboard and run any spec

With the Chrome view:
`npx cypress open`

Or run Cypress headless
`npx cypress run`


### 
Test files are located in cypress/e2e
